# Hashtag Norovirus

An experiment in using social media for public health surveillance.

This is a proposed project for the University of Michigan 2016 [Hacks With Friends](http://cio.umich.edu/michigan-it/hacks-with-friends). This github repository will be a place to collaboratively develop code and documentation.


Initial documentation will take place on the [project wiki](https://github.com/jestill/hashtag-norovirus/wiki).
