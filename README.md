# Hashtag Norovirus

An experiment in using social media for public health surveillance.

This is a proposed project for the University of Michigan 2016 [Hacks With Friends](http://cio.umich.edu/michigan-it/hacks-with-friends). This github repository will be a place to collaboratively develop code and documentation.


Initial documentation can take place on the [project wiki](https://github.com/jestill/hashtag-norovirus/wiki). 

## Resources

The following resources will potentially help with the hack.

### Twitter APIs

### Git and GitHub Resources

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a free and open source version control system designed to facilitate the distributed development of source code for software. [GitHub](https://github.com/) is a public web-based Git repository hosting service with over 10 million users. This service allows inviduals or communities of users to host and collaboartively develop software and related artifacts. GitHub has been used by numerous informatics and cyberinfrastructure initiatives including [OHDSI](https://github.com/OHDSI/), [iPlant/CyVerse](https://github.com/iPlantCollaborativeOpenSource/), [Galaxy](https://github.com/galaxyproject), and [NCIP](https://github.com/NCIP/).

The [LHSNet organization on GitHub](https://github.com/LHSNet) allows the LHS Network to share the technical resources that are required to support the research being conducted by the LHSNet research network.
